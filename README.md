# 2020 NTU COM Tennis Team Official Recruit Website

This site is heavily inspired by [Xiaoying Riley](https://twitter.com/3rdwave_themes)'s DevBook for developers theme. The original demo can be found [here](https://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/demo/devbook/).

As stated, *DevBook* is a **free Bootstrap book and ebook landing page template** made for software developers. But now, it is modified to suit "lazy" developers to quickly build a one-page landing site to promote their events or projects.

## Things I Added
- Jekyll version of the site
- Jekyll Plugins for SCSS files
- Animate on Scroll ([aos](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/)) Library Integration
- More custom styles for more contents
- SEO
- Google Analytics
- Gallery using [fancybox](https://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/docs/)

(see the complete list of features [down below](#Features) 👇🏾)

## Original Author & License
The Bootstrap template is made by UX/UI designer [Xiaoying Riley](https://twitter.com/3rdwave_themes) for developers and is 100% FREE as long as you **keep the footer attribution link**. You do not have the rights to resell, sublicense or redistribute (even for free) the template on its own or as a separate attachment from any of your work.

If you'd like to **use the template without the footer attribution link**, you can [buy the **commercial license** via the theme website](https://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/bootstrap-templates/startup/devbook-free-bootstrap-4-book-ebook-landing-page-template-for-developers/)

> The above statement is the reason why I didn't remake the jekyll theme of the site. But any clone of the repository is more than welcomed.
